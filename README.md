# Heroes of Pymoli
A dataset containing in-game item purchase data of the game, Heroes of Pymoli, is analyzed with Python and Pandas using Jupyter Notebook to scrutinize trends in purchases and player demographics.

For codes, refer to `HeroesOfPymoli_SooBin.ipynb`.

Through this analysis, the following trends are identified:
1. Excluding players who classify their genders as “Other / Non-Disclosed”, there are more male players than female players. However, female players tend to spend more money than male players when comparing average total purchase per person.
2. People in the age band of “20-24 years old” play Pymoli the most (~45% of the player pool) and purchase game items the most. However, players in the age band of “35-39” spends more money than any of the other age bands when comparing average total purchases per person.
3. “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm” is the most purchased item which yields the most total revenue as well.
