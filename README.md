<br />
Uploading a Jupyter notebook to github had some conversion issues, so another one is created from the beginning.

I had an unfortunate accident in which my MacBook keyboards were malfunctioning.. I dropped it off at Apple Store on Saturday last week and the Genius guy told me to wait for a week...<br />
Therefore, I did this assignment using my iPad Pro and Microsoft Azure Notebooks. When I downloaded the completed .ipynb and uploaded to my github repo, however, the notebook was not being properly shown. Instead, I'm attaching the link to my Azure repo which seems to show the notebook alright.<br />
<br />
The following is the analysis for the Pymoli assignment.<br />
<br />
1. Excluding players who classify their genders as “Other / Non-Disclosed”, there are more male players than female players. However, female players tend to spend more money than male players when comparing average total purchase per person.<br />
<br />
2. People in the age band of “20-24 years old” play Pymoli the most (~45% of the player pool) and purchase game items the most. However, players in the age band of “35-39” spends more money than any of the other age bands when comparing average total purchases per person.<br />
<br />
3. “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm” is the most purchased item which yields the most total revenue as well.
